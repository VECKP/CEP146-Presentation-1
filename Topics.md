# Impact of AI in game devlopment 

## Job Displacement
- Automation of roles like QA testers, environment artists (via procedural generation), and even writers (through AI-driven dialogue) may lead to fewer jobs for humans.

- Junior positions are especially at risk, making it harder for newcomers to enter the industry.

## Creative Homogenization
AI often relies on existing data, which can lead to:
- Repetitive or derivative content.
- A lack of innovation or unique storytelling.
- Over-reliance on templates and clichés learned from past games.

## Quality Control Issues
  AI-generated assets (like characters, animations, or dialogue) may:
- Contain bugs, inconsistencies, or inappropriate content.
- Lack the human touch that makes a game world feel emotionally authentic.

 ## Ethical & Legal Concerns
Using AI to generate assets based on scraped data can:
- Violate copyright (e.g. training on artists’ work without consent).
- Spark lawsuits or backlash from creators.
- Developers may face reputation damage if they use AI unethically.
