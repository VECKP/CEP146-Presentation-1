## Impact of AI in game devlopment 

**1. Job Displacement**
- Automation of roles like QA testers, environment artists (via procedural generation), and even writers (through AI-driven dialogue) may lead to fewer jobs for humans.

- Junior positions are especially at risk, making it harder for newcomers to enter the industry.

   **2. Creative Homogenization**
AI often relies on existing data, which can lead to:
- Repetitive or derivative content.
- A lack of innovation or unique storytelling.
- Over-reliance on templates and clich√©s learned from past games.

   Quality Control Issues
  AI-generated assets (like characters, animations, or dialogue) may:
- Contain bugs, inconsistencies, or inappropriate content.
- Lack the human touch that makes a game world feel emotionally authentic.
