## david - quality control issues in AI game development

AI-generated assets, such as characters, animations, and dialogue, can introduce significant quality control issues. These assets might contain bugs, visual or logical inconsistencies, or even inappropriate content. Beyond technical errors, AI often struggles to capture the emotional depth and creativity that human designers bring to games. This can make AI-generated content feel less authentic, affecting the overall player experience. Developers must carefully review and refine AI-created assets to maintain a consistent and engaging quality in their games.
