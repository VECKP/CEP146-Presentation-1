## introduction - Victor  
"AI has brought powerful tools to the game industry; creating revolutionary innovations such as improved NPC behavior and interaction, procedural generation for functional assets, and many more. However, its growing role also introduces many negative effects and today we’re going to look at how they can impact the future of game development." 

## david - quality control issues in AI game development

AI-generated assets, such as characters, animations, and dialogue, can introduce significant quality control issues. These assets might contain bugs, visual or logical inconsistencies, or even inappropriate content. Beyond technical errors, AI often struggles to capture the emotional depth and creativity that human designers bring to games. This can make AI-generated content feel less authentic, affecting the overall player experience. Developers must carefully review and refine AI-created assets to maintain a consistent and engaging quality in their games.

**LINE 1-** Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming the workforce by automating tasks once performed by humans; leading to widespread concerns about job displacement

**LINE 2-**   While AI improves efficiency, and productivity, it also threatens job positions in game development. 

**REF 1-**  When Companies like Microsoft laying-off over 9000 devs  and cutting jobs in to be replaced with AI on xbox. It leads to many workers facing uncertainty as companies adopt AI-driven systems to reduce labor costs. 

**ENDING-** The challenge lies in balancing innovation with job security, ensuring that workers are retrained and supported during this technological transition. Without thoughtful regulation and investment in education, AI could deepen economic inequality and reshape employment in unpredictable ways.

## Ethical and Legal Concerns - Tofa

Artificial intelligence has accelerated the process of creating game art and designs but it has also created some major problems. Some AI tools have also used real artists’ work without permission, resulting in copyright issues and even lawsuits. Artists have sued companies such as Midjourney and Stability AI for using their art in AI training without permission, *The Art Newspaper and AI Business reported.*

That’s why it’s especially important that developers use AI responsibly and make sure they aren’t infringing on the creativity or rights of real artists.
