## introduction - Victor  
"AI has brought powerful tools to the game industry; creating revolutionary innovations such as improved NPC behavior and interaction, procedural generation for functional assets, and many more. However, its growing role also introduces many negative effects and today we’re going to look at how they can impact the future of game development." 

## david - Quality Control Issues In AI Game Development

AI-generated assets like characters, animations, and dialogue are becoming more common in game development, especially since they can save studios a lot of time and money. But there’s a big downside to relying on them too much.

According to gamedeveloper.com, more developers are worried about generative ai actually lowering the quality of games, saying ai-made content can feel repetitive or soulless.
Another report by drillimation systems also points out that ai-generated assets often lack cohesion and creativity.

So while AI can definitely speed up development, it can’t replace that human touch just yet. developers still need to go in and polish, edit, and make sure everything feels genuine. Finding that balance between efficiency and creativity is what’ll really shape the future of game design.

**LINE 1-** Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming the workforce by automating tasks once performed by humans; leading to widespread concerns about job displacement

**LINE 2-**   While AI improves efficiency, and productivity, it also threatens job positions in game development. 

**REF 1-**  When Companies like Microsoft laying-off over 9000 devs  and cutting jobs in to be replaced with AI on xbox. It leads to many workers facing uncertainty as companies adopt AI-driven systems to reduce labor costs. 

**ENDING-** The challenge lies in balancing innovation with job security, ensuring that workers are retrained and supported during this technological transition. Without thoughtful regulation and investment in education, AI could deepen economic inequality and reshape employment in unpredictable ways.

## Ethical and Legal Concerns - Tofa

Artificial intelligence has accelerated the process of creating game art and designs but it has also created some major problems. Some AI tools have also used real artists’ work without permission, resulting in copyright issues and even lawsuits. Artists have sued companies such as Midjourney and Stability AI for using their art in AI training without permission, *The Art Newspaper and AI Business reported.*

That’s why it’s especially important that developers use AI responsibly and make sure they aren’t infringing on the creativity or rights of real artists.

## Creative Homogenization - Gabriel

Artificial intelligence technology has greatly enhanced efficiency and creativity in game development, but it has the potential to lead to **creative homogenization**. Because AI technologies are trained on existing game data, they allow existing patterns, styles, and ideas to be generated on other games.This can lead to repetitive gameplay, predictable narratives, and an art style that feels very familiar. 

While the incorporation of AI-generated content can certainly help expedite production and therefore has value, it may lead to lesser levels of originality and emotional payoff that come from human's capacity for creativity. 
Developers and studios just need to be careful not to depend on AI, or the industry may find itself lacking the diversity of ideas and artistic capability that has always existed. 

The key to preventing any lack of diversity in perspectives will be using AI as a creative assistant, rather than a substitute for the creative mind. 
The gaming space can innovate and expand its identity while continuing to inspire.
